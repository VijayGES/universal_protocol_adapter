universal protocol adapter (UPA)

The **Universal Protocol Adapter (UPA)** is a versatile hardware interface device designed to enable communication between a PC and a wide range of embedded systems and peripheral ICs through a USB connection. Acting as a bridge, the UPA supports multiple communication protocols including **I2C**, **SPI**, **1-Wire**, **UART**, **JTAG**, and **Wiegand**, allowing developers, engineers, and technicians to interact with and program various digital devices using a single, unified tool. Through dedicated software on the PC, users can configure and control these protocols in real-time, streamlining tasks such as debugging, firmware updates, testing, and device configuration. The UPA is particularly valuable in development and diagnostic environments where multiple protocol types need to be accessed from a single USB port without switching between different adapters.
